# Project Description
The purpose of this project was to learn about various stereo image correspondence algorithms. 
There were two algorithms implemented in this project. The first algorithm is a simple windowed
local algorithm that uses the sum of absolute difference metric to compare disparities. The second
algorithm is also window based. This algorithm is based on loopy belief propagation and Markov chains.
The following images illustrate the results of the more accurate belief propagation algorithm:

The first is a fast and inaccurate local
algorithm that computes the sum of absolute difference (SAD) distance metric between the left image window 
and the prospective right image window. The index of the right image window with the lowest SAD score
has its disparity value appended to the depth map. This simple algorithm can be summarized as follows:
1. Iterate through each row of pixels in the left image
2. For each x value in the left image, iterate over all of the possible disparity values
3. Compute the SAD between a left image window at x and a right image window at x_search
4. Append the disparity value with the lowest SAD score to the depth map

This algorithm was able to compute a depth mapping in approximately 5 seconds each time it was called.


The second algorithm is much slower, but more accurate. This algorithm is based on belief propagation and 
markov chains. In this algorithm an initial "guess" of the
disparity map is computed using the fast algorithm based on the SAD metric above. After this "guess" is obtained, a smoothing matrix 
is computed by calculating the difference between the center pixel and the upper, lower, right, and left 
pixels in the SAD matrix. This smoothing matrix is used in the next iteration of the depth mapping 
algorithm to obtain a significantly stronger estimate. 

This algorithm takes approximately 3 minutes to compute a depth mapping from two images.
